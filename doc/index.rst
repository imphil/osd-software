Open SoC Debug Software Reference Implementation
################################################

This is the reference implementation of the Open SoC Debug host software, i.e. the part of Open SoC Debug typically executed on a "standard" PC.
The documentation is split in three parts.

The :doc:`Overview Documents <01_overview/index>` provide a general big-picture introduction to the ideas and concepts of OSD.
They are written for a wide technical and non-technical audience.

The :doc:`Developer Documentation <02_developer/index>` provides techncial information about the implementation of the OSD host software. 
Read this documentation for information how to create software based on ``libosd``, or how to extend the reference implementation itself.

Finally, the :doc:`(End) User Documentation <03_user/index>` shows how to use the various tools provided by this reference implementation.
This documentation is intended for end users, i.e. people trying to debug a system using OSD.
